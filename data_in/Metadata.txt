We relied on the MUMA package for metabolite identification. The metabolite structures were collected mainly from public repositories such as LIPID MAPS (www.lipidmaps.org), ChEBI (www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi), HMDB (www.hmdb.ca), BMRB (www.bmrb.wisc.edu), PubChem (http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and KEGG (www.genome.jp/kegg/). Additionally, the metabolite structure database contains structures of metabolites identified by the data depositors in their metabolomics experiments. In MUMA, in addition to curation of metabolite structures and assignment of common properties such as name, systematic name, exact mass and molecular formula, the metabolites are classified either using the LIPID MAPS classification systems for lipids or by the ClassyFire classification system (Feunang, Y.D. and Wishart, D.S. Unpublished work), a tool for automated structure-based taxonomic classification of chemical entities. Each metabolite in the structure database is also mapped to the following external database IDs, to the extent possible: PubChem CID, LMSD ID, CHEBI ID, HMDB ID, Chemspider ID, METLIN ID, BMRB ID and MetaCyc ID. These approaches/database resources are common in this field.
